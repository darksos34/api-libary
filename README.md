## 1. What is a CRUD REST API?
A CRUD REST API allows clients to perform basic operations on resources via HTTP requests. These operations include creating new resources, reading existing ones, updating resource data, and deleting resources. It adheres to the principles of REST, ensuring a predictable and uniform interface for communication between clients and servers.</br>

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete):
* CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
* It represents the four fundamental operations used to interact with database applications.
These operations allow developers to manipulate data within a collection or database. Hereâ€™s what each function does:
- Create: Adds new entries to the database.
- Read: Retrieves entries based on specific criteria (such as filtering or searching).
- Update: Modifies specific fields in existing entries.
- Delete: Removes one or more existing entries entirely.

#### For example, in SQL (a popular language for interacting with databases), the equivalent functions are Insert, Select, Update, and Delete.
